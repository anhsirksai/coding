+ A vector contains a block of contiguous initialized elements -- if element index k has been initialized, then so have all the ones with indices less than k.

+ An iterator can be incremented or dereferenced, and two iterators can be compared. There is a special iterator value called "past-the-end"(it.end()).

+ sort takes two random iterators, and sorts the elements between them. ``` sort(v.begin(),v.end());```
