 At the end of 4 or 5 rounds the panel will be in a comfortable state to judge about his 
 Coding, 
 debugging, 
 logical thinking, 
 understanding of his basics, DS/Algo, System Design, Leadership, etc.
 
 I would say writing a file copy function, quick sort, etc is not the right scale for measuring the candidate competency. They have to posses good problem solving ability mixed with good coding skills.
 logical thinking, optimization, effective coding
 
 I am in a situation to design custom algos/DS in many cases, so looking for a team mate with these skills seems to be important.
