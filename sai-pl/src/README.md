The idea for creating this repo is picked up from Hema09(github handle) and is extended to suit my coding practice style.

## Interviewer's prespective:
 At the end of 4 or 5 rounds the panel will be in a comfortable state to judge about his 
 Coding, 
 debugging, 
 logical thinking, 
 understanding of his basics, DS/Algo, System Design, Leadership, etc.
 
 I would say writing a file copy function, quick sort, etc is not the right scale for measuring the candidate competency. They have to posses good problem solving ability mixed with good coding skills.
 
 logical thinking, optimization, effective coding
 
 I am in a situation to design custom algos/DS in many cases, so looking for a team mate with these skills seems to be important.
 
 ## Merging upstream changes directly in github into a already forked repo.
Here’s how to update your fork directly from GitHub (as shown in the video above):

- Open your fork on GitHub.
- Click on Pull Requests.
- Click on New Pull Request. By default, GitHub will compare the original with your fork, and there shouldn’t be anything to compare if you didn’t make any changes.
- Click on switching the base. Now GitHub will compare your fork with the original, and you should see all the latest changes.
- Click on Click to create a pull request for this comparison and assign a predictable name to your pull request (e.g., Update from original).
- Click on Send pull request.
- Scroll down and click Merge pull request and finally Confirm merge. If your fork didn’t have any changes, you will be able to merge it automatically.
