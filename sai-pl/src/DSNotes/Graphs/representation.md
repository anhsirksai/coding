### advantage of adjacency list representation over adjacency matrix representation of a graph :
 
- In adjacency list representation, space is saved for sparse graphs.
- DFS and BSF can be done in O(V + E) time for adjacency list representation. These operations take O(V^2) time in adjacency matrix representation. Here is V and E are number of vertices and edges respectively.
- Adding a vertex in adjacency list representation is easier than adjacency matrix representation.
