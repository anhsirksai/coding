### 248 :
1. Given lengths(costs) of ropes, find the total minimum cost of creating a single rope. (cost of two ropes = length1 + length2).
2. Find all the diagonal sums of a binary tree

### 246:
####  Round 1:
1. Spiral printing of 2D matrix.
2. Given an array of 0s and 1s . I was asked to return the index of a zero turning which will produce a longest continuous 1s.
    Ex 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1. here turning the last 0 to 1 will form 5 ones. this is the longest of all.

####  Round 2:
1. basic implementation of stack.
2. finding the middle element of a linked list
3. printing the vertical sum of a tree.
4. given an array of integers where the number go increasingly and at a point will start decreasing something like the following.```2 3 4 5 6 7 8 6 4 3 2.``` we need to find the turning point of this series. in this example it is 8.

### 180:
3. What is TRIE?
4. Write the function for insert and search for TRIE?
5. DFS and BFS .
6. How to get the shortest path from (0 , 0) to (r , c) in a rectangular grid in which some cells are blocked.
